\begin{abstract} Many palaeoclimate proxies share one challenging property: they
are not only driven by the climatic variable of interest, e.g., temperature, but
they are also influenced by secondary effects which cause, among other things,
increased variability, frequently termed \emph{noise}. Noise in individual proxy
records can be reduced by averaging the records, but the effectiveness of this
approach depends on the correlation of the noise between the records and
therefore on the spatial scales of the noise-generating processes. Here, we
review and apply this concept in the context of Antarctic ice-core isotope
records to determine which core locations are best suited to reconstruct
local-to-regional-scale temperatures. Using data from a past-millennium climate
model simulation equipped with stable isotope diagnostics we intriguingly find
that even for a local temperature reconstruction the optimal sampling strategy
is to combine a local ice core with a more distant core $\sim500$--$1000$\,km
away. A similarly large distance between cores is also optimal for
reconstructions that average more than two isotope records. We show that these
findings result from the interplay of the two spatial scales of the correlation
structures associated with the temperature field and with the noise generated by
precipitation intermittency. Our study helps to maximise the usability of
existing Antarctic ice cores and to optimally plan future drilling campaigns. It
also broadens our knowledge on the processes that shape the isotopic record and
their typical correlation scales. Finally, the presented method can be directly
extended to determine optimal sampling strategies for other palaeoclimate
reconstruction problems.

\introduction

The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of firn and ice recovered from
polar ice cores is a key proxy for past near-surface atmospheric temperature
changes \citep{Dansgaard1964,Lorius1969,Masson-Delmotte2008,Sjolte2011}.
Although the physical mechanisms that link local changes in temperature to the
isotopic composition of precipitated snow are generally well understood
\citep{Dansgaard1964,Craig1965,Jouzel1984} and can be modelled with general
circulation models
\citep{Joussaume1984,Werner2011,Werner2016,Sjolte2011,Goursaud2018}, the
quantitative interpretation of ice-core isotope variability, in terms of
temperature variability, is complicated by second-order processes that
influence the isotopic record, adding noise \citep{Munch2018a}.
% Here, an analysis of the typical spatial scales on which the different processes
% act offers a way to minimise the variability which is not related to temperature
% by identifying an optimal combination of locations to average ice-core records.

Specifically, the isotopic record that is derived from an ice core is the result
of a chain of processes: (1) atmospheric temperature changes, (2) isotopic
fractionation during the pathway from atmospheric moisture to precipitation, (3)
the effect of variable and intermittent precipitation and finally (4) local
depositional and post-depositional effects. Each element of this chain can be
associated with a typical spatial length scale over which it is correlated, as
will be outlined in the following.

Atmospheric temperature variations drive the isotopic composition fractionation
of the atmospheric moisture along its pathway to the final stage of
precipitation \citep{Dansgaard1964,Jouzel1984}. The spatial coherence of the
temperature-related isotopic signal in precipitation is hence determined by the
spatial coherence of the variations of the atmospheric temperature field
itself. Typical spatial decorrelation scales for temperature anomalies are on
the order of $\gtrsim1000$\,km \citep{Jones1997}, which implies that ice cores
distributed on spatial scales below $\sim 1000$\,km should typically record a
similar, i.e., correlated, temperature signal. However, the temporal variability
of the isotopic composition in the local atmospheric moisture also depends on
the variability of the atmospheric circulation, since different air masses may
exhibit different source regions and distillation pathways \citep{Schlosser2004,
Sodemann2008a,Birks2009,Kuttel2012}. In addition, the isotopic composition
profile across a deposited layer of snow will not directly reflect the temporal
variability of the atmospheric isotopic signal due to the intermittent nature of
precipitation \citep{Schleiss2015}. By this, the initial isotope signal is
weighted with the amount of precipitation, which introduces bias
\citep{Steig1994,Laepple2011a} and adds additional variability to the isotopic
record \citep{Persson2011,Casado2019}. The latter two processes are linked to
atmospheric dynamics and their typical spatial scales range from the mesoscale
(i.e., tens of kilometres), driven by topography and orographic effects, to
synoptic scales of hundreds of kilometres, associated with cyclonic activity and
the movement of high and low pressure systems. Finally, in polar conditions, the
precipitated snow does not directly settle but is constantly eroded, blown away,
and redeposited. These depositional processes have been shown to give rise to
stratigraphic noise in the isotopic record \citep{Fisher1985,Munch2016}, which
exhibits a small-scale decorrelation scale of a few metres \citep{Munch2016}.%
\footnote{We note that the final isotopic record is also influenced by
  potential snow--atmosphere vapour exchange at the surface and by
  post-depositional processes within the snow and ice matrix, such as
  densification and diffusion. These processes are, however, not within the
  scope of this article.}

This hierarchy of the different spatial scales of the processes influencing an
isotope record determines the effectiveness of reducing the overall noise, since
a reduction in the noise level by averaging records will depend on the spatial
correlation scale of the different noise sources. For example, if an isotope
record were only shaped by temperature variations and stratigraphic noise, it
would be sufficient to average records spaced only tens of metres apart, as this
would ensure highly correlated temperature signals but uncorrelated
stratigraphic noise between the records. However, comparing correlation-based
signal-to-noise ratios derived from nearby isotope records
\citep{Munch2016,Munch2017} with the signal-to-noise ratios estimated from
analysing the records' temporal variability \citep{Laepple2018} shows that
reproducibility on a local scale does not necessarily imply a climatic, i.e.,
temperature-driven, origin. Instead, circulation variability and precipitation
intermittency act as additional noise sources which are likely to exhibit larger
decorrelation lengths than the stratigraphic noise
\citep{Laepple2018,Munch2018a}. Taking this into account, we expect there to be
an optimal length scale, which lies in between the local and the temperature
decorrelation scales and which results in a trade-off between averaging out
atmospheric circulation and precipitation intermittency effects, while also
ensuring a sufficient coherence in the recorded temperature signal.

The aim of the present study is to use data from a climate model equipped with
stable isotope diagnostics to systematically study the different typical process
scales~--~including those from atmospheric temperature variations, circulation
variability, precipitation intermittency and the isotope--temperature
relationship~--, to determine the optimal spatial arrangement of ice-core
locations, which maximises the correlation with temperature at a specific target
site. To address this problem we focus on target sites on the East Antarctic
Plateau. Our results show that the average of multiple ice-core isotope records
yields a higher degree of correlation with temperature when the sampled
locations are spread across distances of $1000$\,km or more from the target
site, than when they are all located close ($<250$\,km) to the target
site. While these results may seem counterintuitive at first, we qualitatively
explain their general features with a simple analytical model that uses the
typical spatial correlation structures associated with the temperature and
isotope fields, and with the noise generated by precipitation intermittency.

\section{Data and methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Climate model data}\label{methods:data}

We use data from the past-millennium simulation (800--2000\,CE;
\citealp{Sjolte2018}) of the fully coupled ECHAM5/MPI-OM-wiso atmosphere--ocean
general circulation model equipped with stable isotope diagnostics
\citep{Werner2016}. This simulation is forced by greenhouse gases, volcanic
aerosols, total solar irradiance, land use changes, and changes in the Earth's
orbital parameters. The model's atmospheric component ECHAM5-wiso is run with
a T31 spectral resolution ($3.75\degree\times3.75\degree$) and with $19$
vertical levels \citep{Sjolte2018}. Compared to observations, the climatological
relationship between temperature and the precipitation isotopic composition is
reproduced well by the model, but it is biased towards warm temperatures in the
T31 setup and its isotopic composition is not depleted enough over Antarctica
\citep{Werner2011}. These issues can be improved upon by using a higher spatial
resolution \citep{Werner2011}; however, such a higher-resolution model is not
needed for our study, since we are mainly interested in the relative variability
between sites and not in the absolute temperature or isotope values. The full
atmosphere--ocean model was compared to observational data and palaeoclimate
records for two equilibrium simulations under pre-industrial and Last Glacial
Maximum conditions \citep{Werner2016}, and the past-millennium simulation was
used to reconstruct North Atlantic atmospheric circulation in combination with
ice-core isotope data \citep{Sjolte2018}.

In this study, we use the 1200-year ECHAM5/MPI-OM-wiso time series of two-metre
surface air temperature ($T_{2\mathrm{m}}$), precipitation ($p$), and oxygen
isotopic composition in precipitation (the relative abundance of oxygen-18 to
oxygen-16 istopes, denoted as $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$) extracted from all model
grid cells on the Antarctic continent ($N_{\mathrm{grid}}=442$).

\subsection{Data processing}\label{methods:prc}

The model simulation output has a monthly temporal resolution, while typically
ice-core isotope records exhibit an annual (or even lower) resolution. The
latter is commonly achieved by averaging the isotopic data across annual layers
of snow and ice, which are determined through a dating approach. The resulting
annual isotopic composition data therefore include a weighting effect due to the
intra-annual variability in the amount of precipitation. To account for this, we
produce two versions of annual data from the monthly model output: (1) the
two-metre temperature and oxygen isotopic composition data are averaged to an
annual resolution without any weighting (denoted as $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ and
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ in the following), and (2) the respective monthly data
are averaged to an annual resolution including the weighting by the monthly
precipitation amount (denoted as precipitation-weighted data
$T_{2\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$).

\subsection{Data analyses}\label{methods:main}

\subsubsection{General approach}\label{methods:general}

We investigate the relationships among the model variables by assessing the
Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$). To derive implications for actual
ice-core studies, we use the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ time series
at the model grid cells as a surrogate for ice-core isotope records. We thus
neglect stratigraphic noise and any further depositional or post-depositional
effects on the isotopic record, since we are interested in the upper limit of
the extent to which ice cores can reconstruct the climatic temperature signal in
the atmosphere. Our analyses are conducted relative to specified grid cells of
interest (target sites; $\mathbf{r}_0$) to obtain results that are relevant on
local-to-regional spatial scales.

\subsubsection{Picking optimal sites}\label{methods:picking}

To determine an optimal set of ice-core locations to reconstruct
$T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ at a given target site we first randomly pick without
replacement a number $N$ of the grid cells that lie within a circle of
$2000$\,km radius around the target site and then correlate the average
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ time series from these $N$ grid cells
with the temperature at the target site. The optimal set of cores for each $N$
is then determined from the maximum correlation value across all trials: For
$N=1$, we can directly pick the optimal location from the maximum correlation
value within the circle without random sampling; for $N>1$, we set the maximum
number $n$ of picking trials to $10^5$ to ensure stable results.

  rings. Also shown are our main study regions (black polygons) around the EDML
  (upward pointing triangle) and Vostok (downward pointing triangle) ice-core
  sites.}
\label{fig:concept}%
\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Optimal sampling structure}\label{methods:opt.sampling}

To learn about the typical spatial scales associated with the processes
contributing to the overall temperature--isotope relationship we use a more
general approach that reduces local effects in the climate model data. We choose
a given target site and define consecutive rings around this site with a
$250$\,km radial width until a maximum distance of $2000$\,km is achieved
(Fig.~\ref{fig:concept}). Then, we identify all the grid cells that fall into
each of these rings and randomly sample $N$ grid cells from out of these
rings. This is implemented in a two-step process: (1) we determine all possible
combinations of selecting $N$ rings with replacement, and then (2) for each
ring combination we identify the possibilities of combining grid cells by
selecting an individual grid cell from each ring. For each of these grid-cell
combinations, we average the time series for a studied model variable
($T_{2\mathrm{m}}$, $T_{2\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$,
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$) and compute the degree of correlation
with the target site temperature. Finally, we report the mean correlation for
every ring combination by averaging across all correlations of the analysed
grid-cell combinations. This provides insight into the average spatial structure
of the correlation with the target site temperature for sampling $N$ locations
from the model field depending on the distances between the locations. We denote
this quantity as the \emph{sampling correlation structure}. Note that in the
one-dimensional case ($N=1$), the sampling correlation structure is identical to
what is often called the spatial correlation structure, i.e., the average
correlation as a function of distance.

In the second step from the above two-step process, it is computationally
feasible to identify all possible grid-cell combinations until $N=2$. For
$N\geq3$ we resort to Monte Carlo sampling instead, for which we estimated a
sufficient number of Monte Carlo iterations from comparing the Monte Carlo
sampling solution for $N=2$ with its exact solution. We found the correlation
mismatch (root mean square deviation) to be $\sim10^{-3}$ for $10^4$
iterations. Based on this, we choose $10^5$ iterations for sampling $N\geq3$
locations, since this larger number of locations involves a larger number of
possible ring combinations and thus many more possible grid-cell combinations.

\subsubsection{Study regions}\label{methods:regions}

We focus our analyses predominantly on two subregions of the East Antarctic
Plateau, the Dronning Maud Land (DML) region and the Vostok region, both of
which include existing deep ice-core drilling sites as well as large arrays of
shallower ice and firn cores.

For the DML region, we choose all model grid cells ($N_{\mathrm{grid}}=26$)
within a range of $\pm17.5\degree$ longitude and $\pm5\degree$ latitude around
the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica DML site (EDML;
$-75\degree$\,S, $0\degree$\,E; Fig.~\ref{fig:concept}). This region encompasses
the site of the deep EDML ice core \citep{EPICAcommunitymembers2006} and $>50$
firn and shallow ice cores \citep{Altnau2015}. For the Vostok region, we choose
an identical latitudinal and longitudinal coverage ($N_{\mathrm{grid}}=30$) with
respect to the Vostok station ($-78.47\degree$\,S, $106.83\degree$\,E;
Fig.~\ref{fig:concept}), encompassing the deep Vostok and Dome C ice cores,
several shallower cores \citep{Stenni2017}, and the new deep drilling site
(``Little Dome C'') where an ice core extending back more than one million years
is envisaged \citep{Passalacqua2018}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Spatial scale of temperature anomalies and temperature--isotope
  relationship}
\label{results:t2m-iso}

We first assess the extent to which a local ice-core record, i.e. the annual
isotope time series of a single grid cell in the model simulation, is
representative for the local and regional variability of the near-surface
atmospheric temperature.

The temperature field over Antarctica in the climate model exhibits generally
large-scale coherent variations (Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.decorrelation.map}) with a
clear two-part structure roughly divided by the range of the Transantarctic
Mountains: For most regions of the East Antarctic Plateau, the temperature field
shows typical decorrelation lengths of $\sim1500$ to $2500$\,km, while the
decorrelation lengths are significantly lower with values $\lesssim1000$\,km for
larger parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and for the Antarctic Peninsula.
Still, for perfect ice cores, i.e.\ assuming an ideal temperature proxy which is
only governed by local temperature variations, a single ice core would capture
the temperature variability in both regions across hundreds of kilometres.
% In order to reduce the uncertainty associated with the
% individual correlation estimates from single grid cells we analyse the expected
% correlation as a function of distance averaged across grid cells and across a
% region of target sites (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}). Here, as an example
% for an existent ice-core drilling region, we choose as target sites all grid
% cells within a range of $\pm17.5\degree$ longitude and $\pm5\degree$ from the
% EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML) site ($-75\degree$\,S, $0\degree$\,E), referred
% to as the Dronning Maud Land (DML) region in the following. We find the
% temperature decorrelation in this region to clearly follow an exponential decay
% with a length scale of $\sim1900$\,km.

  annual near-surface $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ time series with the respective

  grid cells are used for the fit.}

  $T_{2\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ and
  $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$.}
\label{fig:t2m.oxy.correlation.maps}%
\end{figure*}%

However, as simulated by the climate model, actual single Antarctic ice-core
isotope records only explain a low portion of the local temperature variations
and thus of the regional temperature field: Correlating the annual
precipitation-weighted field of modelled
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$, which most closely mimics a real
ice-core record, locally with the annual $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ time series results
in generally low correlations (mean of $0.36$), ranging across all analysed grid
cells from $<0.1$ up to $\sim0.53$ with $\sim70\,\%$ of the correlations
$\leq0.4$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.oxy.correlation.maps}a). The correlation is
improved when we use the $T_{2\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ time series instead
of $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ with a mean local correlation of $0.51$ (range $\sim0$ to
$0.77$; Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.oxy.correlation.maps}b), which shows that
precipitation intermittency is a major limiting factor for the
temperature--isotope correlation. In the following, we will assess the extent to
which the correlation with temperature can be increased and how this is related
to the spatial scales studied.
% In the second step, we determine the average spatial
% strucure of the temperature--isotope correlation as a function of distance
% (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}), assessed for the DML region in the same
% manner as the average temperature decorrelation structure presented above. In
% contrast to the exponential temperature decorrelation, the
% $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ field in the DML region exhibits a much lower but also
% more stable structure of correlation with the target site temperature. Starting
% from a local value of $\sim0.4$, the correlations decrease only slightly with
% increasing distance up to $\sim1300$\,km, followed by a little steeper decrease
% for larger distances and constant levels of $\lesssim0.2$ for distances above
% $\sim1700$\,km. Precipitation weighting, as seen from analysing the
% $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ field, results in overall even lower
% correlation values, but it does not affect much the correlation structure
% itself.

\subsection{Picking optimal ice-core sites for temperature reconstructions}
\label{results:picking}

The above analysis shows that isotope records of single ice cores are expected
to only capture a low portion of the local interannual temperature variability,
suggesting that additional processes influence the isotopic signal which lower
the correlation with the local temperature record, such as precipitation
intermittency. Interpreting these processes as noise raises the question of
whether the correlation with temperature can be improved by averaging isotope
records across space. Here, we first assume an ideal world, in which the climate
model data are a perfect surrogate for the true climate and proxy variations at
each site. We can set up the simple experiment of randomly picking
and averaging specific $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ grid cells to
determine that spatial array of $N$ ice cores which optimises the temperature
correlation with a target site.

For our specific model simulation and the EDML drilling site as a target, we
obtain the interesting result that the optimal location for a single core is not
the local grid cell -- as one might expect -- but a site $\sim1100$\,km away
from the target towards the southeast (Fig.~\ref{fig:picking}a). Choosing this
site increases the correlation with the target temperature from the value of
$0.26$ for directly picking the local EDML site to a value of
$0.44$. Furthermore, by analysing the maximum correlations with the target
temperature for averaging a set of three and five cores
(Fig.~\ref{fig:picking}b--c) we find optimal locations that in both cases
scatter at significant distances around the target and which yield an even
further increase in correlation ($r=0.49$ in both cases). We
obtain similar results for choosing the Vostok drilling site as a target
(Fig.~\ref{fig:picking}d--f). Here, the optimal single core would be at a
location $\sim420$\,km north of Vostok ($r=0.45$, compared to the local
correlation of $0.34$). As for EDML, the optimal locations for averaging three
and five cores all lie around the target without including it, and the
correlation for the optimal set of three cores ($r=0.57$) is significantly
higher than for the optimal single core, while the optimal set of five cores
shows no further increase ($r=0.56$).

%f04
\begin{figure*}[t]%

  isotope composition. Filled black circles denote those grid cells that
  maximise the correlation with the target site temperature for choosing either
  a single grid cell ($N=1$; \textbf{a}, \textbf{d}) or for averaging across
  $N=3$ (\textbf{b}, \textbf{e}) or $N=5$ (\textbf{c}, \textbf{f}) grid cells.}
\label{fig:picking}%
\end{figure*}%

We generalise these findings by analysing the core location of the optimal
correlation for all Antarctic model grid cells as target sites. Indeed, the
majority ($\sim65$\,\%) of optimal locations lie at distances from the
respective target site of between $400$--$600$ and $800$--$1000$\,km.

\subsection{Optimal ice-core sampling structures}
\label{results:optim-spacing}

The approach of picking optimal ice-core locations yields straightforward and
instructive results. However, it might be questionable whether these results are
directly applicable to the real world, since they might depend on the climate
state or result from statistical overfitting. Thus, as a next step, we adapt our
approach in order to more generally learn about the optimal spatial arrangement
of ice cores which maximises the correlation with temperature. For this, we
compute the mean of correlation results obtained between a target site
temperature and individual grid cells in order to reduce local variability in
the model data. We perform this averaging step across combinations of $250$\,km
wide concentric rings around a target site (sampling correlation structure;
Fig.~\ref{fig:concept} and Sect.~\ref{methods:opt.sampling}) to prevent the
results from depending on any specified direction. Additionally, if applicable,
we average so obtained results across the target sites within our defined DML
and Vostok regions (Sect.~\ref{methods:regions}) to obtain regional
estimates. Finally, we analyse each of the model variables to highlight the
differences between the individual fields.

  average correlation as a function of distance between the interannual

  fields of $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ (black), oxygen isotope composition
  ($\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$, green) and precipitation-weighted oxygen isotope
  composition ($\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$, blue). Averaging is
  performed in two steps: first, correlations are averaged across grid cells
  falling in $250$\,km wide consecutive rings around a given target site, and
  secondly, these results are averaged across all respective target sites in the

  indicate an exponential fit to the $T_{2\mathrm{m}}$ data.}
\label{fig:avg.cor.structure}%
\end{figure*}%

When we perform this approach for sampling only a single location ($N=1$), the
resulting sampling correlation structure is equivalent to the average
correlation with distance, and it simply yields the spatial decorrelation in the
case of sampling from the $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$ field itself. Indeed, the sampling
correlation structures for $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$ in the DML and Vostok region
(Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}) can be described by an exponential decay with
a length scale of $\sim1900$\,km in both cases, consistent with the estimated
spatial decorrelation lengths on the local scale
(Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.decorrelation.map}). We note that these results also
simply show that the maximum average correlation with the target site
temperature is obtained for sampling from the innermost ring only.

We can compare this with the sampling correlation structure for the
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ field. In the DML region we find in this case a much
lower average correlation with the target site temperature as a function of
distance (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}a). From a local value of $r\sim0.4$,
the correlations decrease only slightly with increasing distance up to
$\sim1300$\,km, resulting in the highest correlation to be found also for
sampling from the innermost ring, but with nearly equally high correlations
obtained for rings till a distance of $\lesssim1000$\,km. This slight decrease
is then followed by a little steeper decrease for larger distances and constant
levels of $r\lesssim0.2$ for distances above $\sim1700$\,km. For the Vostok
region (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}b), the sampling correlation structure
for $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ exhibits a nearly linear decrease from an initial
value of $r\gtrsim0.5$ to $r\sim0.1$ in the final ring ($>2000$\,km).
When we analyse the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ fields we see that
precipitation weighting induces overall even lower correlation values in both
regions, but that it does not affect much the sampling correlation structure
itself.

\end{figure*}%

Extending this analysis to the two-dimensional case of sampling and averaging
$N=2$ locations offers the possibility of investigating not only the average
correlation as a function of distance from the target site but also depending on
the distance between the two sampled locations
(Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation}). We find that the difference in sampling
correlation structure between the fields of $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$ and
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ is for $N=2$ even more pronounced than
for $N=1$. As one would expect, the maximum average correlation for
$T_{\mathrm{2m}}$ is still found when sampling both locations from the innermost
ring, as shown for the DML region (Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation}a).
However, for $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ the optimal arrangement of
two locations is obtained for sampling one location from the innermost ring but
the second one from the fifth ring, i.e.\ between $\sim1000$ and $1250$\,km from
the target site (Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation}c). Part of this structure
is related to the effect of precipitation intermittency, which can be seen from
the sampling correlation structure for the $T_{\mathrm{2m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$
field (Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation}b). Here, in contrast to
$T_{\mathrm{2m}}$, the correlation is about as high when we combine the
innermost ring and one ring further away, as when we sample both locations from
the innermost ring.

Analysing the Vostok study region leads to comparable results
(Appendix~\ref{app:vostok.n2}: Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation-vostok}), with
a similar difference in sampling correlation structure between $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$
and $T_{\mathrm{2m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ as for the DML region, and a similar
structure of $T_{\mathrm{2m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ and
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ for distances $\lesssim1000$\,km.
However, the results for the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ field
(Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation-vostok}c) do not display such a pronounced
maximum when sampling one location from the innermost ring and the second one
from a ring further away as it is observed for the DML region. This points
towards an influence of the regional differences in the spatial correlation
structure of the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ field
(Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}).

The general feature for sampling $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ is
robust throughout Antarctica, despite the above regional differences. When we
fix the first location to the innermost ring and assess for all available
Antarctic target sites the optimal ring of the second location, for which the
average correlation with the target site temperature is maximal, we find that
in $\sim77\,\%$ of all cases the optimal configuration for the second location
is at least the second ring ($250$--$500$\,km), and in $\sim61\,\%$ of the cases
it is within the second to fourth ring ($250$--$1000$\,km).

\end{figure*}%

Furthermore, we obtain similar results also for averaging $N=3$ and $5$
locations of the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ field to reconstruct
the target site temperature (Fig.~\ref{fig:binning}). For EDML as a target site,
the optimal sampling configuration is such that one location lies in the
innermost ring while the others are distributed at distances between $\sim500$
and $1500$\,km from the target. For reconstructing the Vostok target site
temperature, the optimal locations are mostly distributed across the second to
third ($250$--$750$\,km) ring. In summary, the averaging of locations clearly
increases the average correlation with the target site temperature, if it
follows an optimal combination of rings, as compared to sampling only locally
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cor.increase.risk}a). The increase becomes larger by averaging
more locations: while the local correlation stays constant at $0.27$ (EDML) and
$0.34$ (Vostok), the opimal correlation rises for $N=2$ to $0.32$ and $0.40$,
respectively, and for $N=10$ to $0.39$ and $0.49$. This is equivalent to nearly
a doubling in explained variance.

Finally, we note that these results are the mean value from averaging across
many possibilities of combining individual locations. In reality, any new
drilling campaign or reanalysis of existing ice cores only represents one single
combination of locations. Therefore, we assess the risk of an ``adverse optimal
sampling'', which yields a correlation that is worse in this specific sampling
realisation than the local value. For this, we compare the distribution of all
individual correlations from sampling the optimal ring combination with the
value obtained from sampling only the local sites which lie in the innermost
ring (Fig.~\ref{fig:cor.increase.risk}b). We find the risk of adverse optimal
sampling to be overall low, since more than $92\,\%$ of all individual
correlation values in the example of $N=3$ are actually larger than the
respective local correlation.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Oxygen isotope records derived from ice cores are commonly interpreted to
reflect local temperature changes at the ice-core drilling site. Here, in a
systematic study of the interannual correlation in a climate model between
precipitation-weighted oxygen isotope composition and near-surface atmospheric
temperature, we show that while there is local isotope--temperature correlation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.oxy.correlation.maps}a), this correlation is considerably
increased by averaging isotope records across space following a distinct spatial
pattern which mostly combines the local target site with locations located
between a few hundred to up to $\sim1000$\,km from this site
(Figs.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation}c, \ref{fig:binning} and
\ref{fig:two-core-correlation-vostok}c). In the following, we develop a
qualitative understanding of these results from a conceptual model that predicts
the sampling correlation structure from the processes that shape the isotopic
composition time series, before we discuss the relevance of our results for
actual ice-cores studies.

\subsection{Conceptual model of the optimal sampling structure}
\label{discussion:concept.model}

For a conceptual model of the sampling correlation structure, we focus on three
processes that influence the oxygen isotope records in ice cores: (i)
temperature variations, (ii) precipitation intermittency, and (iii) the
temperature--isotope relationship, and we statistically model the associated
fields of $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$, $T_{2\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ and
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ separately in order to understand the
influence of each process (see Appendix~\ref{app:concept.model} for details).
For comparable results, we assess the average sampling correlation structure
with the target site temperature in the two-dimensional case of averaging two
locations in the same manner as for analysing the climate model data.

To model the atmospheric temperature field, we assume an isotropic exponential
decay of the correlation in space with a constant decorrelation length
(Appendix~\ref{app:concept.model.t2m}). Such an exponential temperature
decorrelation is a commonly observed feature \citep{Jones1997} and also
confirmed by our climate model data (Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.decorrelation.map}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}). Given this relationship, we obtain a good
agreement for the sampling correlation structure for $N=2$ between the
conceptual model and the climate model data, both regarding absolute correlation
values as well as spatial pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:conceptual.model}a). We
emphasise that the maximum correlation with the target site temperature
naturally occurs, in case of an isotropic correlation decay, when the averaged
two (or $N$) locations are close to the target site, as any location which is
further away will result in a smaller common temperature signal between the
locations.

To elucidate the role of precipitation intermittency, we follow the simplest
assumption that this process can be described by partly aliasing the original
temperature signal into temporal white noise \citep{Laepple2018,Casado2019}. We
further assume that this noise is not independent between sites but follows the
spatial scale of the occurrence of precipitation events, which we describe by an
exponential decorrelation in space with a second length scale
(Appendix~\ref{app:concept.model.t2m.pw}). This intermittency length scale is
related to the atmospheric processes that deliver the precipitation,
e.g. synoptic systems, and is hence assumed to be smaller than the length scale
of the temperature anomalies. The introduction of such a second length scale
into our conceptual model can generally explain the optimal sampling structure
we obtain from the climate model data. Qualitatively, close-by locations exhibit
a strong correlation of temperature but also of the noise from precipitation
intermittency, which thus cannot be reduced by averaging those locations,
yielding an overall low signal-to-noise ratio. However, with increasing distance
between the locations, the intermittency noise decorrelates faster than the
temperature field due to the different decorrelation scales, which results in an
optimal distance of maximum signal-to-noise ratio. This is also reflected in our
conceptual model (Fig.~\ref{fig:conceptual.model}b, e). For fixing one location
to the target site, the correlation with the target site temperature first
increases with increasing distance of the second location and maximises at an
optimal distance, before it decays with a further increase in distance. In the
climate model data, we observe a similar feature for the precipitation-weighted
temperature (Figs.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation} and
\ref{fig:two-core-correlation-vostok}), though not as clear as in the conceptual
model. This mismatch could be related to the assumed isotropy in the conceptual
model and the according azimuthal averaging done in the climate model data
analysis, which potentially smears out the intermittency effect in the climate
model data due to slight differences in the decorrelation lengths between the
different horizontal directions.
% Also the range of correlation values matches reasonable well between the
% climate model data and the conceptual model; the latter, however, does not
% reproduce the detailed spatial structure and also fails to explain the clear
% differences in correlation structure between the DML and Vostok regions. This
% suggests a too simplistic implementation of precipitation intermittency in our
% conceptual model, which does not capture its detailed effects and regional
% differences.

In order to incorporate the field of $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$
into the conceptual model, we need to account for the spatial
temperature--isotope relationship. For this, we parameterise the spatial
dependence of the correlation between temperature and the oxygen isotope
composition with a simple isotropic linear model based on the climate model data
results (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure} and
Appendix~\ref{app:concept.model.oxy.pw}). In addition, it is straightforward to
assume the same effect of precipitation intermittency as for the temperature
field. With these simple assumptions, we obtain a good qualitative agreement for
the DML region between the conceptual model and the climate model data results
(cf. Figs.~\ref{fig:conceptual.model}c and \ref{fig:two-core-correlation}c). In
addition, when we change the parameterised isotope--temperature relationship
such that it more resembles the Vostok region data
(Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}b), also the sampling correlation structure in
the conceptual model (Fig.~\ref{fig:conceptual.model}f) is more similar to the
observed one (Fig.~\ref{fig:two-core-correlation-vostok}c). However, in general
the conceptual model here fails to reproduce the actual range of correlations by
showing much lower values than expected.

In summary, our conceptual model provides a quantitative understanding of the
correlation in space of the temperature in the climate model data, and~--~at
least~--~a qualitative understanding of the processes that affect the
correlation between temperature and the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$
field, i.e.\ precipitation intermittency and the spatial temperature--isotope
relationship. The deficiencies of the conceptual model can probably be
attributed to its simplicity. We only assume spatially constant and isotropic
length scales for the governing processes, neglecting local and
direction-related differences in, e.g., temperature decorrelation lengths
(cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:t2m.decorrelation.map}) or the spatial extent of the
coherence of precipitation intermittency, which may be not constant but
different for different types of precipitation, e.g.\ synoptic versus clear-sky
precipitation, and may exhibit directional dependencies related to
topography. Furthermore, we assume constant variance of all time series, which
ignores potential weighting effects on the correlation for the spatial average
of locations due to different variability between them.

\subsection{Relevance for ice-core studies}
\label{discussion:relevance}

The optimal sampling correlation structures, which we obtained from analysing
the climate model data and substantiated with our conceptual model, directly
give a guide where to drill or analyse $N=1, 2, 3$ or more ice cores in order to
optimally reconstruct the atmospheric temperature signal for a certain target
site or region.

If it is only possible to drill or analyse a single ice core, our results
show that it is always best to sample locally, i.e.\ to place this core
close to the target site of interest. This is also common practice, given the
usual interpretation of ice-core isotope records as a proxy for local
temperatures. However, due to the effect of precipitation intermittency, it is
already for the option of drilling two ice cores no longer optimal to place both
these cores locally, but instead to drill one core at the target site and one
further away by at least $500$\,km. In the case of drilling or analysing three
or more ice cores, we expect the optimal spatial configuration to be more
dependent on the study region. But our results indicate that in general it is
still likely better to place one core locally and distribute the others across
several hundreds of kilometres.

We note that these inferences are based on data from a single climate model
simulation together with a simple statistical conceptual model, which should be
tested against observations. In order to do so we need to create an isotope
record that is in first order only governed by temperature variations and
precipitation intermittency by removing the impact of local stratigraphic noise
from the actual measured records (assuming that any further processes in the
pre-depositional to depositional phase only contribute negligibly to the local
isotopic variations). For this it has proven successful to conduct trench
sampling campaigns (see \citealp{Munch2016,Munch2017} for the EDML site). One
test of our optimal sampling structures could then be to combine one trench
record, e.g.\ one from EDML, with another trench sampled at the optimal distance
based on our results for $N=2$, and correlate the average of these two trench
records with the instrumental temperature data set available for EDML. Based on
our results here we would expect a higher correlation in this case than compared
to using only one local trench record from EDML. We note that such an approach
would be challenging due to the small amount of available instrumental data
($\sim20$\,years for EDML) and by the inevitable dating uncertainties between
the the two trench records.

\conclusions

In this study we assessed the question of which spatial sampling configuration
for ice cores optimally reconstructs the annual near-surface temperatures at a
certain site. This problem was motivated by the expectation that the major
processes influencing the isotopic record of ice cores operate on different
spatial scales.

Indeed, by analysing the temperature and isotope data of an isotope-enabled
atmosphere--ocean climate model simulating the climatic history over the last
millennium we showed that while in the optimal setup a single ice core should be
placed on average close to the target site of interest, already the second core
should be put far ($>500$\,km) from the first core. At first sight, this might
be an unexpected result, but we could show by comparing our climate model
results with a simple conceptual model that it can be straightforwardly
explained by the interplay of two different correlation lengths in space: one
for the temperature anomalies and one parameterising the spatial coherence of
the effect of precipitation intermittency.

Our study hence explicitly helps improving the setting up of drilling or
analysis campaigns for spatial networks of ice-core isotope records. In
addition, it provides in general the means to analyse an optimal configuration
of measurement locations for proxies, which are influenced by processes that
exhibit different spatial correlation scales.

\section{Conceptual model of sampling correlation structures}
\label{app:concept.model}

\subsection{General model}
\label{app:concept.model.general}

We set up a conceptual model for the correlation between a target temperature
time series and the spatial average of a set of locations sampled from a
climatic field (sampling correlation structure). Our model builds upon assuming
simple isotropic and exponential decorrelation structures for the involved
climatic fields and on previous work which suggests that precipitation
intermittency can be described by partly aliasing the original temperature
signal into white noise \citep{Laepple2018}.

For the model, we consider a temperature time series $T_0$ at some target site
$\mathbf{r}_0$ and a field $x$ of a given climate variable. From this field, we
select $N$ time series $x_i$ at the locations $\mathbf{r}_i$, $i=1,\dotsc,N$,
and denote the spatial average of these time series by
$\overline{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_i}$. The distances of the $N$
locations from the target site and the distances between the locations are given
by $r_i=|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_0|$ and by
$d_{ij}=|{\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j}|$, respectively. The correlation between
$T_0$ and $\overline{x}$ follows from
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:corr.general}
\mathrm{cor}(T_0,\overline{x})=\frac
{\mathrm{cov}(T_0,\overline{x})}
{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}(T_0)\mathrm{var}(\overline{x})}},
\end{equation}
and it is governed by the covariance between the temperature at the target site
and the climate field at the sampling locations $\mathbf{r}_i$,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cov.general}
\mathrm{cov}(T_0,\overline{x})=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}{\mathrm{cov}(T_0,x_i)},
\end{equation}
%
and by the covariance between the sampling locations through the variance of
their spatial average,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var.general}
\mathrm{var}(\overline{x})=
\frac{1}{N^2}\left(
\sum_{i}^{N}{\mathrm{var}(x_i)} +
2\sum_{i}^{N-1}\sum_{j}^{N}{\mathrm{cov}(x_i,x_j)}
\right).
\end{equation}
%
In our model, as we will show in the following, these quantities depend on the
distances between sites and on the correlation structure of the respective field
$x$.

\subsection{Temperature}
\label{app:concept.model.t2m}

For the near-surface temperature field, $x \equiv T$, we assume a spatially
constant variance, $\mathrm{var}(T_0)=\mathrm{var}(T_i)\equiv\sigma_T^2$, and an
isotropic decorrelation following an exponential decay with a decorrelation
length $\tau$; i.e. the covariance between sites is given by
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:t2m.decorr}
\mathrm{cov}(T_0,T_i)&=\sigma_T^2\exp{\left(-\frac{r_i}{\tau}\right)},\\
\mathrm{cov}(T_i,T_j)&=\sigma_T^2\exp{\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\tau}\right)}.
\end{align}
%
For the correlation between the target site temperature and the spatial average
of $N$ temperature time series then follows
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t2m.corr}
\mathrm{cor}(T_0,\overline{T})=
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\exp{\left(-\frac{r_i}{\tau}\right)}}
{\sqrt{N+2\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}
\sum_{j=i+1}^{N}{\exp{\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\tau}\right)}}}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Precipitation-weighted temperature}
\label{app:concept.model.t2m.pw}

To model the effect of precipitation intermittency, we follow
\citet{Laepple2018} and assume that precipitation intermittency redistributes
the energy of the temperature time series constantly across frequencies,
i.e. creating temporal white noise without changing the total variance. Then,
the precipitation-weighted temperature time series at the location
$\mathbf{r}_i$ arises from $T_i$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:precip.weighting}
T_i^{\mathrm{(pw)}}=
\left(1-\xi\right)^{1/2}T_i + \xi^{1/2} \sigma_T \varepsilon_i(0,1),
\end{equation}
%
where $\varepsilon_i(0,1)$ are independent normally distributed random variables
with zero mean and standard deviation $1$, and the parameter $0\leq\xi\leq1$
determines the fraction of the input temperature time series which is aliased
into white noise.

The covariance between the target site temperature and a precipitation-weighted
temperature time series is then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t2m.pw.decorr}
\mathrm{cov}(T_0,T_i^{\mathrm{(pw)}})=
(1-\xi)^{1/2}\sigma_T^2\exp{\left(-\frac{r_i}{\tau}\right)},
\end{equation}
%
which implies that the spatial correlation structure between $T_0$ and the
precipitation-weighted temperature follows the same exponential decay as
Eq.~\eqref{eq:t2m.decorr}, only scaled by the factor $(1-\xi)^{1/2}$. The factor
$\xi$ can be estimated from the climate model data by analysing the local
correlation, i.e. at the same grid cell, between temperature and
precipitation-weighted temperature.

We further assume that the effect of precipitation intermittency is not
independent between sites but is related to the spatial coherence of the
precipitation fields, for which we assume an exponential decorrelation structure
with a decay length $\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}$. Following these assumptions, the
spatial covariance between sites of the white noise terms induced by the effect
of precipitation intermitteny has the form
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:noise.cov}
\mathrm{cov}(\varepsilon_i,\varepsilon_j)=
\exp{\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}}\right)}.
\end{equation}
%
Then, the correlation between the target site temperature and the spatial
average of $N$ precipitation-weighted temperature time series is governed by the
intermittency factor $\xi$ and by the two spatial length scales $\tau$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}$,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t2m.pw.corr}
\mathrm{cor}\left(T_0,\overline{T}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}\right)=
\frac
{\sqrt{1-\xi}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\exp{\left(-\frac{r_i}{\tau}\right)}}
{\sqrt{N + 2\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N}
  g(d_{ij}; \tau, \tau_{\mathrm{pw}}, \xi)}},
\end{equation}
%
with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp.fun}
g(d_{ij}; \tau, \tau_{\mathrm{pw}}, \xi):=
(1-\xi)\exp{\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\tau}\right)} +
\xi\exp{\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}}\right)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Precipitation-weighted oxygen isotope composition}
\label{app:concept.model.oxy.pw}

For the field of precipitation-weighted oxygen isotope composition, $x \equiv
\delta^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$, we assume the same effect of precipitation
intermittency as for the temperature field. Furthermore, an analysis of the
climate model data suggests that also the oxygen isotope field largely exhibits
an exponential decorrelation structure in space (not shown). Hence, the
correlation between the target site temperature and the spatial average of $N$
$\delta^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ time series is obtained in a similar manner as for
$T^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:oxy.pw.corr}
\mathrm{cor}\left(T_0,
  \overline{\delta}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}\right)=
\frac
{\sqrt{1-\xi}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathrm{cor}\left(T_0,\delta_i\right)}
{\sqrt{N + 2\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N}
  g(d_{ij}; \tau_{\delta}, \tau_{\mathrm{pw}}, \xi)}},
\end{equation}
%
where $\tau_{\delta}$ is the decorrelation length of the $\delta$ field and the
only difference to Eq.~\eqref{eq:t2m.pw.corr} is the unknown spatial correlation
structure between the temperature at the target site and the oxygen isotope
field, $\mathrm{cor}\left(T_0,\delta_i\right)$.  Based on our climate model
results (Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}), we parameterise this function with a
simple linear decay of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t2m.oxy.corr}
\mathrm{cor}\left(T_0,\delta_i\right)=
\begin{cases}
  c_0 - \gamma d, & d \le d_0,\\
  0, & d > d_0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma=c_0/d_0$ and $d_0$ is some threshold distance above which
the correlation is zero.

\subsection{Model parameter estimation and model results}
\label{app:concept.model.estimation}

In total, our model is governed by three decorrelation lengths ($\tau$,
$\tau_{\delta}$, $\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}$), the intermittency factor $\xi$, and
two parameters describing the temperature--isotope correlation ($c_0$, $d_0$).

We estimate $\tau$ from the climate model data for the DML and Vostok regions
(Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}), as well as in the same way
$\tau_{\delta}$, and find for both regions values of $\tau=1900$\,km and
$\tau_{\delta}=1100$\,km. The intermittency factor $\xi$ follows from the
local correlation between temperature and precipitation-weighted temperature
(Eq.~\ref{eq:t2m.pw.decorr}). We find an average value for the DML region of
$\xi_{\mathrm{DML}}=0.73$ which is close to the average value for entire
Antarctica ($\xi_{\mathrm{Ant.}}=0.71$), while the intermittency is stronger for
the Vostok region ($\xi_{\mathrm{Vostok}}=0.82$). We parameterise the
temperature--isotope correlation in the DML region with $c_0=0.4$ and
$d_0=6000$\,km and with $c_0=0.5$ and $d_0=2500$\,km in the Vostok region
(Fig.~\ref{fig:avg.cor.structure}). The only unconstrained parameter is the
decorrelation length of the effect of precipitation intermittency,
$\tau_{\mathrm{pw}}$, since it is unclear by which precipitation variable it is
mainly goverend (total annual amount, seasonal amount or its distribution). An
investigation with reanalysis data yielded scales between $\sim300$ to $500$\,km
for different precipitation variables \citep{Munch2018a}, while our model data
exhibits an average decorrelation length of $\sim600$\,km for the annual
precipitation amount. Here, for the conceptual model we choose a value of
$500$\,km.

We can test our assumption for the effect of intermittency based on using the
estimated values of $\tau$ and $\xi$ to predict the spatial decorrelation
between temperature and precipitation-weighted temperature
(Eq.~\ref{eq:t2m.pw.decorr}). Indeed, this yields a comparably good fit to the
data as an independent fit (root mean square deviation of $\sim0.03$ between
data and fit in both cases), supporting our assumption that intermittency can be
parameterised by a partial conversion of the time series into white noise.

In a similar manner as for analysing the climate model data, we now use our
conceptual model to predict the two-dimensional ($N=2$) sampling correlation
structures for the different model fields of $T_{\mathrm{2m}}$,
$T_{\mathrm{2m}}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{(pw)}}$
(Eqs.~\ref{eq:t2m.corr}, \ref{eq:t2m.pw.corr} and \ref{eq:oxy.pw.corr}). Since
our model space is continuous, we sample from locations placed \emph{on}
concentric rings around the target site. We either sample the two locations from
the same ring or from two different rings, using ring radii from $0$ to
$2000$\,km in increments of $10$\,km, and calculate the average correlation for
a specific ring combination. To obtain meaningful expectation values, we choose
$36$ locations distributed uniformly across each ring in steps of $10\degree$,
combine these locations one by one for each ring combination, and average across
the correlations from each location pair. With the model parameters for the DML
and Vostok regions we obtain the results displayed in
Fig.~(\ref{fig:conceptual.model}), which we discuss and compare to the estimated
results from the climate model data in the main text.
