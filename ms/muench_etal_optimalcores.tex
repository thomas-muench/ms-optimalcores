\begin{abstract} Many proxies used in climate research share one complicating
property: they are not only driven by the climatic target variable of interest,
e.g. temperature, but also influenced by secondary effects which cause
additional variability, frequently termed \emph{noise}. Noise in individual
proxy records can be reduced by averaging them together, but the effectiveness
of this approach depends on the spatial correlation scales of the involved
noise-generating processes. Here, we apply this concept to Antarctic ice cores
in order to optimise local to regional scale temperature reconstructions from
ice-core isotope records. We use data from climate model simulations to identify
an optimal arrangement of ice-core arrays which maximises the signal-to-noise
ratio in the reconstruction with minimum effort. Our results suggest that, in
order to optimise the temperature reconstruction at a target site in Dronning
Maud Land on the East Antarctic Plateau (\#EDIT generalise to EAP?), it is
nececssary to combine local records with ice cores separated $\sim500-1000$\,km
away from the target. We show that this result can be largely explained by the
interplay of the two spatial scales associated with the coherence of the
temperature field and of the noise generated by precipitation intermittency. In
summary, our study helps to maximise the usability of existing ice cores as well
as to optimally plan future drilling campaigns. It also deepens our knowledge
concerning the typical coherency scales of the different processes that shape
the isotopic record.

\introduction

The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of firn and ice recovered from
polar ice cores is a key proxy for past near-surface air temperature changes
(\#REF). Although the physical mechanisms that link local changes in temperature
to the isotopic composition of precipitated snow are generally well understood
(\#REF) and can be modelled with general circulation models (\#REF), the
quantitative interpretation of ice-core isotope variabily in terms of
temperature variability is complicated by second order processes that
additionally influence the isotopic record, creating noise (\#REF). Analysing
the typical spatial scales on which the different processes act helps to
minimise variability, which is not related to temperature, by averaging ice-core
records from an array of sites.

The isotopic record that is derived from an ice core is the result of a chain of
processes from (1) atmospheric temperature changes to (2) the isotopic
fractionation during the pathway of the atmospheric moisture, (3) the effect of
variable and intermittent precipitation and finally (4) post-depositional
effects; each element of this chain can be associated with a typical spatial
scale.

Atmospheric temperature variations drive the fractionation of the isotopic
composition of the atmospheric moisture along its pathway to the final stage of
precipitation (\#REF). The spatial coherence of the temperature-related isotopic
signal in precipitation is hence given by the spatial coherence of the
atmospheric temperature field itself. Typical spatial decorrelation scales for
temperature are of the order of $\gtrsim1000$\,km (\#REF), which implies that
ice cores distributed on spatial scales below $\sim 1000$\,km should record a
similar, i.e. correlated, temperature signal. However, the temporal variability
of the isotopic composition in the local atmospheric moisture also depends on
the variability of the atmospheric circulation, since different air masses may
exhibit different source regions and distillation pathways (\#REF). In addition,
in an ice core, the isotopic composition in a deposited layer of snow will not
one-to-one reflect the temporal variability of the atmospheric isotope signal
due to the intermittent nature of precipitation (\#REF), which weights the
initial isotope signal with the amount of precipitation, thereby introducing
bias and adding additional variability to the isotopic record (\#REF). Both
processes are directly linked to the atmospheric dynamics, and their typical
scales are hence expected to range from mesoscales (i.e. tens of kilometres),
driven by topography and orographic effects, to synoptic scales of hundreds of
kilometres associated with cyclonic activity and the movement of high and low
presssure systems (\#REF). Finally, in polar conditions the precipitated snow
does not directly settle but is constantly eroded, blown away and
redeposited. It has been shown that this gives rise to stratigraphic noise in
the isotopic record (\#REF:fisher) which exhibits a small-scale decorrelation of
a few metres (\#REF:trench).%
\footnote{We note that the final isotopic record is influenced by further
  post-depositional processes within the snow and ice matrix, such as
  densification and diffusion, which are, however, not within the scope of this
  article.}

This hierarchy of process scales~--~from temperature to the atmospheric isotopic
composition, to the precipitation-weighted isotopic composition, and finally to
post-depositional effects~--, determines the effectiveness of reducing overall
noise by averaging isotope records, since the reduction of the noise level will
depend on the spatial correlation scale of the different noise sources. For
example, if we only considered temperature and stratigraphic noise, it would be
sufficient to average records spaced just some tens of metres apart, as this
would ensure highly correlated temperature signals but uncorrelated
stratigraphic noise between the records. However, the comparison of
correlation-based signal-to-noise ratios of nearby isotope records (\#REF) with
those estimated from analysing the record's temporal variability (\#REF) has
shown that reproducibility on a local scale does not necessarily imply a
climatic, i.e. temperature-driven, origin. Instead, circulation variability and
precipitation intermittency act as further noise sources which are expected to
exhibit larger decorrelation lengths (\#REF:cp18,cycles) than the stratigraphic
noise. Taking this into account, we expect some optimal length scale in between
the local and the temperature decorrelation scale which is a trade-off between
averaging out circulation and intermittency effects and ensuring a sufficient
coherence of the recorded temperature signal.

Here, we use data from a climate model equipped with stable isotope diagnostics
to learn about the different process scales and to link this to the optimal
arrangement of ice-core locations, with a focus on the East Antarctic Plateau
(EPA). For a target location in Dronning Maud Land (\#EDIT), our results suggest
a combination of local records with ice cores separated $\sim500-1000$\,km away
from the target in order to maximise the correlation with the target temperature
signal. This result also holds when assessing the range of correlations for an
arbitrary sampling of such combinations (\#riskanalysis). In general, optimal
sampling can increase the correlation with the target temperature by x-y\,\%
when averaging x-y cores as compared to a local reconstruction using only a
single record (\#EDIT).
